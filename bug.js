This error occurs when using Expo's `Constants.deviceId` to uniquely identify a device, but the value returned is unexpectedly null or undefined.  This can happen due to several reasons, including incorrect permissions, timing issues, or problems related to device simulators. The code attempts to access the device ID immediately after the app loads, when it might not yet be available.
